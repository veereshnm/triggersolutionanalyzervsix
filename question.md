Please provide the complete code and setup instructions for a Visual Studio 2022 Professional extension project (CallGraphExtension) targeting .NET 8, which adds a 'Create Call Graph' context menu option in the C# code editor. When right-clicking a method in a C# file, the extension should extract the method name, containing class, namespace, and solution path using Roslyn, then execute a pre-built SolutionAnalyzer.exe with these parameters to generate a callchain.json file. The extension should copy callchain.json to the src/assets/ directory of an Angular project (call-graph-app) located at C:\Projects\call-graph-app, and run ng serve to visualize the call graph. Ensure the project uses an SDK-style .csproj, includes necessary NuGet packages (Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK@17.9.34902.98, Microsoft.VSSDK.BuildTools@17.9.4108, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.Common@4.14.0, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp@4.14.0), and addresses previous issues like the AsyncPackage CancellationToken error. Provide all files, including CallGraphExtension.csproj, source.extension.vsixmanifest, CallGraphCommand.cs, CallGraphCommandPackage.cs, and CallGraphCommand.vsct, along with detailed setup instructions for Visual Studio Professional 2022.
